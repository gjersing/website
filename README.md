# website
https://gjersing.herokuapp.com

This is the website where I will begin uploading my projects as well as an about me section.
I plan to try and convert projects into code that can work on Flask and having them be live on the website.
For other projects I plan to embed youtube videos where I go over the project and some of it's code.

I utilize a virtual environment on my machine in order to verify the site functionality.
